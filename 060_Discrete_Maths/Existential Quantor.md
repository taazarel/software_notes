# Existential Quantor

This is basically a case of finding something that exists in a set using [[Propositional Function]]s.

For example: "There exists a number in the real numbers that is neither positive or negative", would be true, since zero is a real number. 

It would be written as 

$$
\exists x \in \mathbb{R}, x<0 \land x>0
$$

Therefore $\exists x P(x)$ is true if just _one_ value in P(x) is true.
