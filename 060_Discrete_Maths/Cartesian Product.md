# Cartesian Product

The cartesian product is a set which is a set of all the ordered pairs of two sets, in cartesian coordinates.[^1]

$$
A \times B = \{ (a,b)|a \in A \land b \in B \}
$$
- $ Example given $x = \{ 0,1,2 \}$ and $y=\{ 4,3 \}$, then the cartesian product is:
$$
x \times y = \{ (0,4),(0,3),(1,4),(1,3),(2,4),(2,3) \}
$$
$$
y \times x = \{ (4,0),(4,1),(4,2),(3,0),(3,1),(3,2) \}
$$

The [[Cardinality]] of a [[Cartesian Product]] is the same as the [[Cardinality]] of its members multiplied.

This means that the empty [[Set]] in a cartesian product will always give the cardinality of the empty set back.

The [[Cartesian Product]] of multiple sets $A_{1},A_{2},\dots,A_{n}$, is the set of ordered n-tuples $(a_{1},a_{2},\dots,a_{n})$, where $a_{i} \in A_{i}$.

$$
A_{1}\times A_{2}\times\dots \times A_{n} = \{ (a_{1},a_{2},\dots,a_{n})|a_{i}\in A_{i} \text{ for } i=1,2,\dots,n \}
$$
