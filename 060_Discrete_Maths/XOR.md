# XOR

This is called XOR/Exclusive OR it is written as $\oplus$.

We can use this operator to find cases where both variables are unique/exclusive.

| p   | q   | p x q |
| --- | --- | ----- |
| T   | T   | F     |
| T   | F   | T     |
| F   | T   | T     |
| F   | F   | F     |

It will always return True if the inputs are different, and false if they are the same. VEEEERY useful. üëç
