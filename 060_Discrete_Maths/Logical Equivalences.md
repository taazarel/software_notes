# Logical Equivalences

This is a list of various [[Logical Equivalences]], which are just cases in which all outputs are the same for two different compound [[Proposition]]s.

![[De Morgan's laws]]

## Conditional [[Disjunction]] Equivalence

Says that [[Implication]] is the same as $\neg p\lor q$.

## A Distributive Law

With these we can just apply p to both elements in the parentheses. Ergo distribute them.

$$
p\lor(q\land r)\equiv(p\lor q)\land(p\lor r)
$$
$$
p\land(q\lor r)\equiv(p\land q)\lor(p\land r)
$$

## Double Negation

$$
\neg(\neg p)\equiv p
$$

## Associativity of [[Conjunction]] and [[Disjunction]]

We can straight up just ignore parentheses in these cases

$$
(p\lor q)\lor r\equiv p\lor(q\lor r)
$$
$$
(p\land q)\land r\equiv p\land(q\land r)
$$
