# Conjunction

If p and q are both true then the conjunction will be true.

This is the "and" operator, it is written $\land$.

Given p and q the truth table for conjuction reads

| p   | q   | $p\land q$ |
| --- | --- | ---------- |
| T   | T   | T          |
| T   | F   | F          |
| F   | T   | F          |
| F   | F   | F          |
