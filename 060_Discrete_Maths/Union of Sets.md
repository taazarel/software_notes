# Union of [[Set]]s

This is something which contains everything in both sets.

If C is a union of A and B, then C contains everything in them, and they are thus [[Subset]]s of C.

$$
A\cup B= \{x|x \in A \lor x \in B\}
$$

OH! That uses a [[Disjunction]] ðŸ˜¼

## Collection of Sets

The union of a collection of sets, are elements which are contained in at least one member of the collection.

$$
A_{1}\cup A_{2}\cup\dots \cup A_{n}=\bigcup_{i=1}^{n}A_{i}
$$
