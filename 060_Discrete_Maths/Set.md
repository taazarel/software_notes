# Set

A set is an unordered collection of distinct objects.

We can denote that an element belongs to a set with $n \in S$. And show what the set contains by doing the following $S = {0,1,2,3,\dots}$ 

## Important Sets

Listed by hierarchy, sets below are in sets above.

- The complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$
- The real numbers $\mathbb{R}$
- The rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$
- The whole numbers (integers) $\mathbb{Z}$
- The natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$
- The empty set, does not contain anything $Ã˜ = \{\}$

## Building Sets

We can also use logic in sets since its often impossible to list all its elements.

- $ Example; S is the set for all x in the real numbers for which F(x) is true.
$$
S = \{x \in \mathbb{R}\vert F(x)\}
$$
