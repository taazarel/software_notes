# Proposition

A proposition is a statement that can be either true or false, ergo it will have a [[Boolean]] value.

For example, we can say that the proposition "2+2 = 4" is true. Or that the [[Set]] of real numbers is contained by the [[Set]] of complex numbers.

Propositions and [[Negation]]s can be used to make a [[Conjunction]].
