# Universal Quantor

Is denoted by $\forall$ and just means that every element inside a set shares something.

The [[Universal Quantor]] is used on a [[Propositional Function]].

For Example: $\forall x \in \mathbb{Z}, x^{2} > 0$ would be false, since x can be zero.

Or. $\forall x \in \mathbb{Z},x+1>x$ is true

Therefore the [[Universal Quantor]] is actually a [[Proposition]], since it can be either true or false.
